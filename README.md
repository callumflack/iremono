# Iremono

Iremono is a semi-atomic CSS styling kit for designing in code.

## Note well

This is a work in progress. I will be actively updating it in use on current projects. Expect breaking changes.

## How to use it

1. Install: `yarn add callumflack/iremono` or `npm i callumflack/iremono`.

2. Create a variables file. See `variables.example.css`. This lists all the css custom properties used. You can customise everything in `iremono` from this file.

3. Import your `variables.css` and `iremono` into your CSS index file, as described below. The order of imports matters: add your variables first, then font-faces (if required), and then `iremono`. Theme stylings should be last. This way, all utilities and mixins within `iremono` will be available to use in your theme css as well.

```css
/* Variables */
@import "./variables.css";

/* Font faces, if you wish */
@import "./typography/font-face.css";

/* Iremono */
@import "iremono/index.css";

/* Theme your websiteâ€¦ */
@import "./theme/button.css";
```

4. Finally, this postcss library makes use of `postcss-mixins`, `postcss-easy-import` and `postcss-preset-env`. Manage their config with a `postcss.config.js` file, an example of which is provided in this repo.

## Documentation

Some form of documentation will be done in time. The best way to check it out is to download it and have a play. Here's a few opionated techniques I've used:

1. Responsive typography using ems against a body font-size in rems, whose value is updated at media queries.
2. Updating the value of css custom properties in media queries. This means I can manage things like white space responsively with a single line of css that holds a single custom variable. No complicated and tediously managed media queries.
3. The most used utilities are name-spaced with their type's initial letter. For example, width classes start with `w-`. But not every utility is namespaced this way. I don't want to remember too much to use the system.

## What does Iremono mean?

Iremono means "vessel" or "container" in Japanese. I don't speak Japanese, but I came across it serendipitously and I liked how it incorporates the word "mono". I wanted to create a standalone set of CSS patterns I could just drop in to any project. So in my naive dot-connecting way, a "mono vessel" sounded right. The name has stuck for some time.
