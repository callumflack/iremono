# Iremono

Iremono is a semi-atomic CSS styling kit for designing in code.

## Note well

This is a work in progress. I will be actively updating it in use on current projects. Expect breaking changes.

## How to use it

1. Install: `yarn add callumflack/iremono` or `npm i callumflack/iremono`.

2. Create a variables file. You can customise everything pattern in the library there. See `variables.example.css` for an example file listing all current variables (aka css custom properties).

3. Then import your `variables.css` and `iremono` it to your CSS imports directory file, as described below. **note well:** the order of imports matters. Add your variables first, then font-faces (if required), and then `iremono`. Theme stylings should be last. This way, all utilities and mixins within `iremono` will be available in your theme css as well.

```css
/* Variables */
@import "./variables.css";

/* Font faces, if you wish */
@import "./typography/font-face.css";

/* Iremono */
@import "iremono/index.css";

/* Theme your websiteâ€¦ */
@import "./theme/button.css";
```

4. Finally, this postcss library makes use of `postcss-mixins`, `postcss-easy-import` and `postcss-preset-env`. I like managing their config with a `postcss.config.js` file, an example of which is provided in this repo.

## Documentation

Some form of documentation will be done in time. Suffice to say, no docs at the moment. the best way to check it out is to download it and have a play ðŸ¤£. I will, however, list a few techniques:

1. Responsive typography using ems against a body font-size in rems, whose value is updated at media queries.
2. Updating the value of css custom properties in media queries. Too much fun not to do.
3. Updating custom properties in media queries means I can manage things like white space responsively with a single css class that holds a single custom variable. No enormous classes full of the same list of media queries over and over.
4. The most used utilities are name-spaced with their type's initial letter. For example, width classes start with `n-`. Not every utility is namespaced this way as I find it too hard to remember them all.

## What does Iremono mean?

Iremono means "vessel" or "container" in Japanese. I don't speak Japanese, but I came across it serendipitously and I liked how it incorporates the word "mono". I wanted to create a standalone set of CSS patterns I could just drop in to any project. So in my naive dot-connecting way, a "mono vessel" sounded right. The name has stuck for some time.
